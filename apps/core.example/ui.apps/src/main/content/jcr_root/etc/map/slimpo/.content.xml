    Regular Expressions for Reverse/Outgoing Mappings

    If there is a sling:internalRedirect property containing a regular expression
    the map entry will be exclusively used for reverse mappings (i.e. used only for ResourceResolver.map(...)) (see also SLING-2560).
    The same resource may carry a sling:match property with wildcards and groups referring to the groups being defined in the sling:internalRedirect property.
